##### Our Mission
KORITEK (KOminoté RIral TEKnology) is non-profit organization whose primary mission is built a pathways out of computer illiterate student in rural area in Haiti by providing them with the tools needed for a better education and obviously close the technology gaps in Rural Area.
 
##### Our Work
We offer computer training/classes to teachers and student in Rural Area.

##### Objective
Build awareness of the importance of Education for Rural People as a crucial step to achieve the Millennium goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and achieving universal primary education;
Overcome the urban-rural education gap;
Increase access to basic Education for rural people;
Improve the quality of basic education in rural areas;
Foster the national capacity to plan and implement basic education plans to address the learning needs of rural people.

##### Target Group
This Project will benefit all students in Bocozelle, one of the 5th Sections communal of the commune of Saint-Marc, chief place of Artibonite as well as all teachers in the surrounding area. As October 4, 2018, Bocozelle has four (4) elementary schools and none of them have a computer lap. We in KORITEK, we believe the lack of adequate school resources and poor training of the teachers in rural area are the principal reasons we see so many countryside/village people flee to the cities leaving their villages with no hope for the future. With today new Technology, we are confident that those students don’t have to leave their home and they can be as competitive as those who live in the cities.

##### Estimated Budget
$24,236.00
